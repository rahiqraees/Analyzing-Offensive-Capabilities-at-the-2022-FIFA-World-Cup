# Analyzing Offensive Capabilities at the 2022 FIFA World Cup âš½

This project applies **statistical modeling in R** to analyze team offensive capabilities at the **2022 FIFA World Cup**. Using logistic regression and beta regression models, we evaluate metrics such as **expected goals (xG)**, **expected successful passes (xP)**, and **expected assisted goals (xAG)**. The analysis leverages **event-level data from StatsBomb** to provide team and player insights.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Built **logistic regression models** for expected goals (xG) and expected passes (xP)  
- Developed a **beta regression model** for expected assisted goals (xAG)  
- Used **StatsBomb event-level data** via the `StatsBombR` package in R  
- Created an **R Markdown report** documenting the methodology and findings  
- Designed a **slideshow presentation** summarizing the research question, models, and results  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Findings
- **Overperformers**: Portugal (+4.9 goals above xG) and Netherlands (+4.54 goals) scored far more than expected
- **Underperformers**: Brazil (â€“4.01 goals below xG) struggled despite elite attacking talent
- **Passing (xP)**: Spain overperformed the most, completing 119 more passes than expected, with heavy midfield concentration
- **Assists (xAG)**: France and England were the top overperformers due to clinical finishing from MbappÃ© and Kane:content
- **Tactical Insight**: Strong midfield play (e.g., Argentina with Messi, Croatia with ModriÄ‡) correlates with offensive efficiency

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- R  
- RMarkdown  
- Libraries: `StatsBombR`, `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `glm`  

## ðŸ”¹ Repository Contents
- **`all_codes_file.Rmd`** â†’ Full R Markdown source code and analysis  
- **`FIFA 2022.pptx`** â†’ Slideshow presentation with visuals and results  
- (Optional) Knitted HTML/PDF report generated from the R Markdown
